# What is SystemsFair?
SystemsFair (formerly MechExpo) is the Engineering Career Fair at Simon Fraser University (SFU)’s Surrey Campus. Created in 20xx, SystemsFair provides a venue for engineering students to meet with employers in the industry one-on-one, and get a feel for the tech community and the opportunities available to them, and for employers to scout student talent and gain exposure for their organizations.

SFU’s Surrey Campus is an emerging technology hub where more than 600 students are working
towards their MSE degree. To recruit top mechatronics engineers from SFU, Companies and organizations take advantage of co-operative education (co-op) program that each MSE student is part of. Organizations offer intern positions to connect with mechatronics student talent early.
