SystemsFair is the Engineering Career Fair at Simon Fraser University (SFU)â€™s Surrey Campus. Created in 2014, SystemsFair provides a venue for engineering students to meet with employers in the industry one-on-one, and get a feel for the tech community and the opportunities available to them, and for employers to scout student talent and gain exposure for their organizations.

SFU's Surrey campus is an emerging technology hub where over 800 students are working towards their MSE or SoSy degree. Companies and organizations take advantage of the co-operative education (co-op) program to recruit top mechatronics engineers and software developers from SFU, often offering internship to connect with these talents early.
